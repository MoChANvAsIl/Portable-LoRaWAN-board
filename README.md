It is a self-contained whiteboard for your ideas with a LoRaWAN wireless communication interface.
The board is powered by 18650 batteries, the connector for which is located on the bottom side of the board. There's also an energy-harvesting microcircuit here, so it's a fully self-contained board.
There are two connectors for I2C and UART sensors that you can use in your projects.
The Arduino IDE has a core for this LoRa module!
